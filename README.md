# Tic Tac Toe
This is the second project from [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).  <br />
You can try it live [here](https://razvanbugoi.github.io/TOP-tic-tac-toe/src/index.html). <br />


## Objective
The main focus of this project was to try and minimize the amount of global functions and variables as much as possible by using modules and factory functions.
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the browser. You can check the game description and rules [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) <br />


## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


## The process and outcome
The first thing that I had to do was setting up the HTML elements. Then, with CSS, I styled and positioned every component according to the design I had in mind. <br />

The next step was to work on the JavaScript logic and create all the necessary functions to make the application work as intended.  <br />
I struggled in the beginning as I wasn't exactly sure how to work with modules, IIFE, and factory functions, but in the end I understood what I needed to do and how. <br />

There were a few obstacles along the way (conditionals not working properly, the reset button wasn't doing what I needed it to do, etc), but I asked for help on Discord whenever I got stuck and couldn't figure it out on my own, and in the end everything works as expected. <br />
